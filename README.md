A early version of my first person mod for the game.
Still has some issues, related with the player brifielly appearing on the screen, mainly during combat. Since I don't know how to edit animations or make the player invisible only during gameplay, I will probably end up just turning the entire model invisible, the downside of this is that there would be no James during cutscenes. I can't promise to keep updating the mod. I would like to make the mod good as possible, but my time is short and I have many other projects already.
