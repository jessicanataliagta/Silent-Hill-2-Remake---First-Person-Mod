A early version of my first person mod for the game.
Might still has some issues, I'm not sure. Before I had a problem with the player brifielly appearing on the screen, mainly during combat. Since I don't know how to edit animations or make the player invisible only during gameplay, So I made the entire model invisible, the downside of this is that there would be no James during cutscenes. And no, I couldn't just pull the camera a few inches in front of James, because the combat animations bend his body too far and too low. The only solution is indeed do the same as first person games, which is just turn the player or parts of the body invisible.
This version of the mod turns James model invisible, I dont know if this will cause issues, I still need to test more.
I can't promise to keep updating the mod. I would like to make the mod good as possible, but my time is short and I have many other projects already.
